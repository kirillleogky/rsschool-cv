#### Summary
I want to become a web developer and create useful and innovative products.

In development, I like to look for the optimal solution to various problems because often there are many options—this is a kind of challenge for me. I am inspired by the fact that I quickly see the result of my work. You can change some parameters and clearly see the result of their work.

Also, I’m improving my soft skills:

- team work. Adopting the experience of the guys and constant self-improvement and development as a web developer will help me learn new things on real projects, not on examples from Internet resources.

- english. English is important because all modern documentation is written in English and to have fresh knowledge I learn the language.

I try to understand the topics in which I have certain questions on my own and thoroughly with the study of examples, specifications, and not just by reading the solution of the problem somehow.


#### Education
